# NCKRL

**NCKRL**, negative triple confidence for knowledge representation learning, is an extended model of TransE and enhanced version of CKRL. The concept of negative triple confidence can generate high quality negative triplets to some extent, which were used to support model training for detecting noises in knowledge graph, while learning robust knowledge representations simultaneously.

## Data

- FB15K

  | Dataset | #rel  | #ent   | #train  | #valid | #test  |
  | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ |
  | FB15K   | 1,345 | 14,951 | 483,142 | 50,000 | 59,071 |

  Different ratios of negatives on FB15K.

  | Dataset      | FB15K-N1 | FB15K-N2 | FB15K-N3 |
  | ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | #neg triples | 46,408   | 93,782   | 187,925  |

- WN18

  | Dataset | #rel | #ent   | #train  | #valid | #test |
  | ------- | ---- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ----- |
  | WN18    | 18   | 40,943 | 141,442 | 5,000  | 5,000 |

  Different ratios of negatives on WN18. Following the practice of generating noises on FB15K, we construct WN18-N1, WN18-N2 and WN18-N3.

  | Dataset      | WN18-N1 | WN18-N2 | WN18-N3 |
  | ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
  | #neg triples | 14,144  | 28,289  | 56,577  |
